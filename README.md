# NilePreneurs-EmbeddedTrack-Project

This is the final project in Embedded Software Development Track at Nile Preneurs Training.
The project can be considered as Speed Control System by connect two Micro controllers togrther using UART.
First MCU is connecting to two Push Buttons which Increase & decrease the speed of motor then Passing this action to the second MCU.
Second MCU is responsible of controlling the speed of the DC motor depending on Push buttons actions which are recived from the first MCU
by UART,also it display the speed of that DC motor at a LCD.
